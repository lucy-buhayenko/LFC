## Exploring scooby
What changes have occured over time?

I might start by generating a **lot** of plots with `data_aired` on othe x-axis.

Here's one:

```{r}
ggplot(scooby,
       aes(x = date_aired,
           y = imdb)) + 
  geom_point()
```

There are clusters. Why?

Maybe network?

Or show name?

**I can do a bunch of plots to try to find to find out.**

```{r}
ggplot(scooby,
       aes(x = date_aired,
           y = imdb,
           color = network)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```
