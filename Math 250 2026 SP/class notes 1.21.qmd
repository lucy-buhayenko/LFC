A bit more on markdown. We can make lists with bullets or numbers.

- point 1

- point 2


1. numbered point 1

2. numbered point 2


Here's a link to [my wesite](https://www.equitableequations.com)

Let's make a code chunk. We set chunk options using #| at the top.
```{r}
#| label: setup 
#| #include: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse) # load ggplot, etc
library(readxl)

scooby <- read_excel("scooby.xlsx")
```

Some useful chunk options include, message, eval(evaluate code or not) and echo (show code in addition to output).These can be true or false

You can also add global options to the yaml header at the top. I've added code-fold: true, which can be nice. The Quarto cheat sheet is a nice resource for this as well as for the chunk options.
