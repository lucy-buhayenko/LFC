	<img src = "107_images/scooby.png" width = "50" height = "50" alt = "scooby flexing muscles"> <br> <br>
	
	Can you also tell tell it is an empty element?
	yes because you never close the img tag
	
	Here is the syntax: <br>
	&lt;img src = "image location and name" width = "width value in pixels" height = "height value in pixels" alt = "alternate text"> &gt;
	<br><br>
	
	if you don't include alt, then you'll have a broken image<br><br>
	
	for visual imperad people they will hear the alt text also. <br><br>
	
	page is holding the place for image reserved. it can process other code after it but once image is received, <br><br>
	then it goes through the width and height and then outputs it to the page<br><br>
	src = location and name of the file<br><br>
	
	you need to make folders for each time you have images for hw<br><br>
	
	you need to have a file that will be inside the 107_images, the code will find it because the new folder that is `107_images` will be inside the of the `CSCI-107`
	
	
	width = 45<br>
	height = 50<br><br>
	
	aspect ratio = width / height<br><br>
	so if 45/50 = 30/? then ? = 50*30 / 45<br><br><br>
	
	<p>
	<img src = "107_images/homer.gif" width = "50" height = "50" alt = "homer in car"> <br> <br>
	</p>
	<h1 style = "color: dark yellow" >It will display as the block element, then you just put it into the &lt;<p>&gt;</h1>
	<img src="https://share.google/images/b7M5zxua5gT9aBK4M" 
     width="300" 
     height="225" 
     alt="google">

	
	<br><br><br>
	what is better absolute or relative?<br><br>
	- relative because absolute keeps changing all the time and the location or name of the image might change<br>
	- absolute URL are powerful but for websites is not the best option<br>
	
	<a href src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildebeest" width = "50" height = "50" alt = "wildebeest">wildebeest</a>
	<img src="images/Wildebeest.png" width = "150" height = "105" alt = "widlebeest">
	
	<h1> It is a clickable image</h1>
	
	first you do:
	sports/volleyball.html
	
	absolute is : &lt;<a href = https://www.csci;lakeforest.edu/~student/sports/vollyball.html"> link </a>&gt;
	relative: <a href = sports/volleyball.html> link </a>
